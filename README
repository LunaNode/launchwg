This is the code for subspace wireguard vpn server launcher at https://launchwg.lunanode.com

To run, simply:

	go run main.go

When a user requests to provision a VM, the webserver will read cloud-config and
replace parameters with user-specified configuration. The resulting script will
be passed as a startup script to the VM, via cloud-init.

To run using docker compose with ACME https reverse proxy:

	echo "LE_EMAIL=myemail@mydomain.com" > .env
	echo "LE_HOSTNAME=mydomain.lndyn.com" >> .env
	sudo docker compose up -d

It requires access to bind to ports 80 and 443 when using https reverse proxy.

Updating:

	git pull origin master
	sudo docker compose restart launcher-go

Though docker restart is not needed if only items in the static folder
are modified. If the go file or run.sh file is modified, it must be restarted.
